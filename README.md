# Kuychi Drone Race Frame
The Kuychi drone raceframe has been developped over the course of more than 5 years of drone racing, 
it englobes a plethora of features such as lightweight, compact, nimble, solid, it uses a 1 screw removable arm for quick repairs, 
it supports the new TBS LUCID ESC mount as well as a 20x20 stack mount
the arms are meant to be 6MM thick wich will be very hard to break, 
the arm locking system leaves no place for play and incorporates a TPU piece that will take out any slack due to cut tolerences

all the STL required to run this frame are included in here!
